            <b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</b>
            <br>
            My interest in IT is mainly the coding aspect since I admire and I'm amazed by the ability to instruct a computer to complete a task.
            Furthermore, I never really acknowledged until now, how my interests in editing videos and cars are greatly affected by IT.
            However, these interests in IT did not start with my hobbies, it instead sparked from learning how to purchase a non-fungible token straight from the smart contract. By scrolling through the hundreds of lines of code in the smart contract, I had an urge to understand the code that was written. Another moment that piqued my interest was how resellers would implement programmed bots to purchase the exceeded limit of shoes and gaming consoles.
            <br>
            <b>Outline your IT experience (if any) & Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b>
            <br>
            Despite having no experience in IT (without counting the simple interaction with a smart contract), this curiosity has caused me to take action in understanding this wild world of IT by coming to RMIT.
            My choice in choosing RMIT was from the recommendation of Open Universities Australia and the reviews from my fellow peers. This was also greatly influenced by the opportunity to study online at a reputable university.
            <br><br>
            <b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b>
            <br>
            By taking this course, I expect to have a taste of the IT industry and be able to expect the type of work, ethics and culture involved.
            Furthermore, I look forward to gaining an insight on the different sectors of the industry and learning the skills and knowledge required for each.
            Besides learning and also despite this course being online, I hope to make like minded friends and connections that last over the duration of the course.
            Overall, I expect to gain an understanding of IT and be more prepared for the Information Age that surrounds us.

          <p>The choice of full-time or permanent position being offered by Telstra, requires the applicant to have a deep understanding as a software engineer in order to implement their skills and knowledge to sustain the health of their existing software applications. In addition, Telstra expects the ability to design and develop effective and well built software applications and solutions that are inlign with Telstra's requirements. Since Telstra is a telecommunications and technology company, the applicant plays a role in making sure the software is delivering quality user experience to its customers. This position makes it appealing to me personally as Telstra is a well-known company and it would allow me to not only work with big tech, but have the opportunity to add my inputs and be a necessary role in scaling the business. Most importantly, the pay and the other experts I would be working closely with and learning from.
<br><br>
        Unsurprisingly, Telstra requires a considerable amount of experience, skills and knowledge as a software engineer stated by their recruitment post on Indeed.com. This is made clear through their demands of having heavy experience using Java and is mentioned that a Java certification in software or database development is highly regarded.This is due to the fact that the applicant is expected to have experience in using softwares such as Spring, Hibernate and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) which can all be used via Java language. Additionally, experience in CSS/SCSS and HTML 5 are also demanded along with exposure to the different aspects of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and using relational databases for database development. Another vital skill needed is to be able to utilize both end to end and unit testing to ensure that all components of the software are functioning as needed. Lastly, being familiarised with either Stencil, Angular and React frameworks as well as Test-driven development/Behaviour Driven Development are essential.
<br><br>
        Currently, I have absolutely zero IT skills, qualifications and experience to even have a shot at landing this job. However, I can obtain these abilities by getting the most out of and finishing my Bachelors of information Technology. To gain more experience, I can try applying for internships for organizations in similar fields and complete online courses to gain a better understanding of programming languages. In addition, there are certified online courses offered by major universities and companies that I can complete in order to build my qualifications. Despite the daunting journey ahead of me to acquire the skills and experience, I perceive this journey as a challenge to build on my strengths and weaknesses.

            <b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
            <br>
            After taking the tests, most of the results from these tests were agreeable and relatable to me as a person and how I think, interact and learn. Due to this, these results allowed me to reflect and be honest with the positives and negatives that I saw within myself. Overall, the results state that I am a rational, creative and intuitive person who learns best from hearing.
<br><br>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? <br>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </b>
<br>
          Personally, I don’t really think these results would influence a noticeable difference to be called a “change” in my current behaviour and decisions when working with a team. However, these results allowed me to acknowledge my own strengths and weaknesses whilst recognising a difference for others. For example, as an “Architect” according to the 16 Personality Test, it's best if I work alone or in a small group which can help me choose a desired group size. When forming a team, I wouldn't see choosing people who have similar personalities as necessary, but I would instead focus on creating a supportive and healthy work environment that promotes positivity in order to reach our common goal. Furthermore, I would also allow my team members to play to their strengths and assist in other areas. Overall, the results of these tests don't really mean much to me and isn't completely valid since I can change a lot overtime and the answers can vary depending on the scenario

      <div class="paragraphFour">
        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
          <p>In today's world, it is said that attention is the modern currency. With that being said, I have decided to take part by creating and designing a platform for content creators and viewers to enjoy. In order to stand out from similar platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and others alike, this app’s main feature is to provide users with a limited amount of likes per day. The likes/hearts given to content creator’s videos will act as an in-app currency that can be traded in for fiat or for other premium utilities only purchasable by likes. By implementing this twist, hopefully it can be unique enough for the masses to be entertained by.
<br><br>
          With around 1 billion active monthly users for TikTok and Instagram and approximately 2 billion active monthly users for Youtbe, According to, “smperth.com”, it's clear that there is an ever growing market for content-sharing platforms. Keeping this fact in mind, it would be interesting to see what content the majority of people value more as they swipe to find content worthy enough for their likes. To add on, as users seek to find content that is deserving for their “like”, it increases the possibility of a higher user watchtime which is beneficial for the app’s reputation. Finally, this feature creates a supply and demand reaction for likes which ultimately leads to only quality content to be produced and given recognition.
<br><br>
          <b>Description of features.</b>
          <br>
          After downloading the app, the user will be greeted with a prompt to create an account or be a guest with limited access to the features. To create a verified account, the user will be required to verify their age, confirm their email address or phone number. By verifying an account, the user gains access to all the features of the app and can start off by completing their profile by adding their profile picture, creating a bio and choosing the option to be a private or public account. In the profile section of the app, the upper portion will display the user’s number of posts, followers, following and likes, whilst the bottom showcases their public content for people to watch. In the top right of the profile, there will be an icon of three lines that will pop up to show icons of the user’s account information, saved and liked videos, messages, settings and options.
<br><br>
          In order to move from one section of the app to another, there will be icons displayed through the very top and bottom portion of the layout. The top icons presented will represent followed content and a default content page. The bottom icons will represent the search tab, upload feature, activity tab and user profile. In the followed content tab, it will display content from creators that the user follows which can be watched by swiping left for a new video, and swiping right to go back to the previous video. Similarly, the default content page will have the same mechanics but will instead be a curated feed based on the user’s likings and engagement. The search tab will allow users to search for other accounts and will act as an explore page full of trending videos. The upload feature is a way for users to film/upload videos, edit them and apply filters or songs. Lastly, the activity tab displays a feed of new likes, comments and follows that the user gains. When watching videos, the creator’s profile will be shown on the screen along with a like, comment and share icons. There will also be an option to report another user’s account for violating any terms and conditions.
<br><br>
          Each day, the user will be given 10 likes to spend and will be worth 0.03 usd. These likes can then be cashed in or be spent on premium features that can make their account stand out. These premium features can be profile banners, gifs as their profile picture, coloured comments and much more. However, a content creator will be unable to cash in their likes until they reach 10,000 followers.  As this app continues to grow, so will the improvements in order to ensure user satisfaction.
<br><br>
          <b>Tools and Technologies</b>
          <br>
          As anyone would guess, it would be greatly difficult to develop and design an app single-handedly. Therefore, the first tool needed would be an experienced team of app developers and designers. By forming a team, it allows different parts of the apps to be built simultaneously, thus making it more efficient. The softwares needed are Flutter and Dart. Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google (Gaël Thomas 2019, freecodecamp.org) that uses the programming language called Dart . Furthermore, flutter creates native machine code through your code and offers pre-built widgets which ultimately saves time creating code for both IOS and Android platforms. Lastly, the hardware needed would be a computer and the accessories in order to write and store the code.
<br><br>
          <b>Skills Required</b>
          <br>
          The skills required to complete this project would be to first have a thorough understanding of javascript, swift or java programming languages. By having heavy experience in some or all of these languages, it makes learning the Dart language easier due to similarities. Another skill needed is being familiar with not only the Drat language but the flutter software and their features. Learning these skills are feasible but would take some years to master, but finding people with these skills is much faster to find but will be costly.
<br><br>
          <b>Outcome</b>
          <br>
          If this app does become successful, it will be a leading competitor in the content platform market and create a space for up and coming content creators to shine. Furthermore, we will be able to monetize through paid sponsorships of videos and ads or even sell the platform. Overall, I believe this development will help make the market even more competitive and is a great way to build a reputation in the IT field.
